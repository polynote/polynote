Currently, Polynote supports three cell types: text cells,  code cells, and visualization (viz) cells. </p> <p>Text cells are useful for writing rich text explanations, code cells contain  the code that actually gets run in the notebook, and viz cells aid in inspecting and visualizing data. </p> <p>Now that we've seen a text cell, let's create a new code cell. If you hover the mouse above and below the text cell,  you'll see a divider appear with a small <code>+</code> symbol. Clicking on that divider will create a new cell in its place. </p> <p>Go ahead and click on the divider below the text cell to create a new cell there.</p> <p></p> <p>This new cell is a code cell, with its language (by default) set to Scala. You can change the language with the dropdown  \u2013 there's one right above the cell and one on the main toolbar. </p> <p>If you wanted another text cell instead, you can change it to Text as well (but only in the dropdown on the main toolbar)  and it will turn into a text cell.</p> <p></p> <p>Let's enter some Scala code in the code cell. The code we're writing is just a little snippet for demonstration purposes.  Here it is in case you're following along:</p> Demonstration Code <pre><code>import scala.util.Random.nextGaussian\n\nprintln(\"this is some console output!\")\n\nval x = 50\n\ncase class Point(x: Double, y: Double)\nList.fill(x)(Point(nextGaussian * 2 + 5, nextGaussian * 4))\n</code></pre> <p>Once you start typing, you'll see some activity under Tasks on the right as the Kernel is  started. The Kernel is what handles computing the notebook code, including providing code completions and suggestions.  Once it starts, you'll start seeing interactive completions as you type. </p> <p>Run the code cell by pressing Shift+Enter. The cell runs, and output is displayed. </p> <p>Here's what you should see:</p> <p></p> <p>Let's take a closer look at the results of running the cell.</p> <p></p> <p>We can see that a few things happened after running the code:</p> <ul> <li>The console output from the <code>println</code> statement appeared in an area \u2460 below the cell.</li> <li>The variable <code>x</code> defined in the cell appeared in the Symbol Table \u2461 on the right.</li> <li>The final expression of the cell was bound to a variable called <code>Out</code> \u2462 and some information    about it appeared below the console output \u2463.</li> </ul> <p>Because the expression <code>List.fill(50)(Point(nextGaussian * 2 + 5, nextGaussian * 4))</code> results in \"table-like\"  data \u2013 a collection of structured values \u2013 a special representation of it is displayed. In this Cell Result view, we can see the result's schema (the fields of the structured row) along with its type and some icons. </p> <p>Clicking these icons creates a new viz cell below this one, allowing you to inspect the cell's result in more detail.</p> <p>In addition to inspecting the \"result\" of the cell, any other value that's been bound to a variable can be inspected by  clicking it in the Symbol Table.

This allows you to keep  track of which variables are available, which is useful because Polynote keeps track of the cell input scope. </p> <p>Polynote is different from other notebook tools in that a cell's place in the notebook is important. Every cell has an \"input state\" defined by the cells that have run above it. This means that if we create a code cell that defines a value:</p> <pre><code>val foo = 20\n</code></pre> <p>Then another cell below it can use the value <code>foo</code>:</p> <pre><code>val bar = foo * 2\n</code></pre> <p>But, if we then go back and edit the first cell like this:</p> <pre><code>val foo = 20\nval fail = bar * 2\n</code></pre> <p>It won't work! </p> <p>The value <code>bar</code> isn't in the input scope of the first cell, because it was defined in the second cell. This is very different from how other notebook tools operate; they just have one global state that every cell mutates.</p> <p>In Polynote, the input state of a cell is defined completely by which cells are above it. This is a powerful way to enforce reproducibility in a notebook; it is far more likely that you'll be able to re-run the notebook from top to bottom if later cells can't affect earlier cells.</p> <p>Here's an example of the above scenario in practice (reordering the cells rather than editing their content):</p> <p></p> <p>Next, read about mixing programming languages.</p>"},{"location":"docs/code-cells/","title":"Code Cells","text":"<p>Code cells are the basic unit of a notebook interactive coding experience. </p> <p>In addition to providing a code editor, code cells show the output and results of executing the code. </p> <p></p> <p>The top of a code cell has a small toolbar of cell-related functions: a button to run the cell, a drop-down for  switching languages, and buttons for the following functions: </p> <ul> <li>Hiding the cell code </li> <li>Hiding the cell output </li> <li>Splitting the cell (this will allow you to place two cells side by side)  </li> <li>Wrapping the cell's output (this will prevent any horizontal output overflow) </li> <li>Copying the output to clipboard (if present) </li> </ul>"},{"location":"docs/code-cells/#code-editing","title":"Code Editing","text":"<p>Polynote provides a modern code editing experience (interactive autocomplete, error highlighting) built with the  Monaco Editor. </p>"},{"location":"docs/code-cells/#cell-results","title":"Cell Results","text":"<p>The last expression in a cell is treated as its result (just as a Scala function returns the result of the last  expression).
