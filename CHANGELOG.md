# 0.4.0 (Mar 31, 2021)
* **Frontend Rewrite** The frontend has been rewritten from the ground up. This change should be mostly transparent to 
  users, but puts us on a much better footing for future improvements. The rewrite did resolve a few longstanding issues 
  and add a few minor features:
    * Notebook tabs are now restored upon reload (stored in the browser). #451
    * Fix a bug with large notebook scrolling #923
    * Fixed the Kill kernel button in the Running Kernels UI #756
    * Symbol table now clears when the kernel is restarted #208
    * Whitespace in configuration is now trimmed #497
    * Cell status badges are shown after reload #449
    * When the editor is disconnected an obvious error is shown to the user #721 #701
    * Improvements to UI reconnection logic after server restarts #736
* New **Plot Editor**! #1025
  * Brand new plot editor which supports re-editing plots, pie plots, bubble plots, native histogram, coloring by a dimension in many plots, faceted/trellis plots!
  * Data tables (from the data browser) and data views (expando-thingy) can also be embedded persistently in the notebook!
  * No more inspection modal! Itâ€™s a cell in the notebook!
* You can now **Move Cells** #1068
  * Mouse over the cell and select the handle that appears on the left. Drag the cell up or down. 
  * The state of the cell is also carried along with it.
* New **Quick Inspect** UI for Symbol Table #1075
  * Simply hover over a row in the Symbol Table to see a menu with a representation of the value, type information, etc. 
* New **Copy to Clipboard** button added to cells with output.
* Support for **Multiple Scala Versions** at the same time! So far only 2.11 and 2.12, sorry. Blame Spark)
  * The Scala version can now be set per-notebook. It is no longer related to the server Scala version.
  * Distribution now ships with kernels for all supported Scala versions. 
  * Which Scala version to use can also be configured with `kernel.scalaVersion`. It is automatically detected if not configured.
  * `shapeless` was also removed from our dependencies.
* Configuration for **setting JVM options** on Kernels. #695  
* Improvements to **dependency caching** #1042
  * New UI treatment for choosing caching preferences for dependencies. There is a new `...` button next to each dependency. 
  * Behavior depend on the type of dependency: 
    * Cache status of JVM dependencies specified via URL (e.g., `s3` or `http`) can be individually toggled in the UI
    * Cache status of pip dependencies can be toggled in the UI, but doing so will just reset the virtualenv (i.e., it will affect all pip dependencies). 
    * Cache status of coordinate dependencies are always cached. 
* Matplotlib output now defaults to PNG format. It can be configured to SVG format as well using `PolynoteBackend.output_format = 'svg' # or 'png'`. #1037
* Polynote now creates the notebook directory if it doesn't already exist. #964 (thanks @akiyamaneko !)
* Stack traces are now saved into the notebook file #981
* Properly set PYTHONPATH on executors, fix regression causing pip dependencies not to be added to Spark automatically #1000
* Hyperlinks now clickable in text cells #106 
* New `SparkRepr` for `Array[Row]` #999 (thanks @tmnd1991 !) 
* Scalar seqs are now streamed as structs. #1058  
* Added `DEVELOPING.md` (thanks @easel !)

**Deprecations** 
* Configuration option `behavior.kernel_isolation: never` is no longer supported â€“ spark kernels can no longer be 
  launched in-process. `never` is now deprecated; it behaves the same way as `spark` (remote kernel iff notebook uses Spark) 
  and will be removed in a future version.

**Bugfixes**
* Fix for some kernel launching issues (one causing duplicate kernels, another causing kernels to be interrupted erroneously) #996
* Python dependency virtualenv is now reset when a change is detected. #921
* Polynote now shows an error when Python dependencies are not found #450

* Notebooks are loaded incrementally (better responsiveness for large notebook files)
* Some tweaks/fixes for Scala completions and signature help
* Handle case when the browser generates continuation frames over the websocket

# 0.3.9 (May 18, 2020)
* Replaces `0.3.8`, which was retracted after we found a few issues in it that weren't caught. 
* **Stability** A bug that could cause data loss has been fixed in this release. 
* **Backups** Polynote now writes a write-ahead-log (WAL) whenever it gets updates to a notebook. This WAL can be recovered using `polynote.py recover /path/to/wal-file.wal`. This is currently experimental.
* **Backups** Polynote now saves a copy of opened notebooks into the browser's local database. This can be used in case of catastrophic server-side data loss (but where the client has been working).

* Update to ZIO 1.0.0-RC18-2 (this deprecates the `Enrich` macro)
* Front-end static files were moved out of the application JAR, so they can be served directly on disk. This changes the directory structure of the polynote installation by adding a `static` directory which contains the (gzipped) static files. These static files can now be served directly by a dedicated webserver if so desired.
* Write `language_info` metadata to ipynb files (improves interop with notebook tools)

# 0.3.3 (Mar 19, 2020)
* *Automatic conversion of PySpark <-> Spark DataFrames* - it no longer matters which language you used to create the DataFrame!
* *Comment support* Code cells only for now. Highlight some text in a code cell and you'll be able to add a comment, similar to Google Docs.

* Added support for more IPython repr formats: Polynote now understands `_repr_svg_`, `_repr_jpeg_`, `_repr_png_`, and `_repr_mimebundle_`
* Improvement to autocomplete - it should now be higher quality and won't trigger for weird characters like `:`
* Python completion improvements: Function parameter hints should now have types, dictionaries now have key completions, 
  and `jedi` has been updated [for even more goodies](https://github.com/davidhalter/jedi/blob/master/CHANGELOG.rst#0160-2020-01-26)

* Overhaul python stack traces - get the actual error from py4j (e.g., pyspark) exceptions, clean up regular python stack traces. 
* Improve completions in the middle of a line by truncating it when sending to the presentation compiler
* Fix a bug preventing classes extending something imported in the same cell from working properly

# 0.1.19 (July 23, 2019)

* Load the default.yml config even if config.yml itself is empty (normal case upon first installation)
* Add number of queued cells to favicon
* Disable running / editing cells upon disconnect. Attempt to reconnect when window is focused. 
* bust browser cache on release (hopefully you won't need to force-reload after upgrading any more!)
* Fix cyclic reference error
* Fix issue preventing vega interpreter from working properly if a string-typed variable was defined earlier
* Create a virtual environment every time. 
* Lazy vals no longer cause compile errors (they still have some problems though as detailed [here](https://github.com/polynote/polynote/issues/374))
* Fix compile error preventing definition of functions with default values. 

# 0.1.18 (July 17, 2019)

* Python Dependency support!
  * You can now specify Python dependencies (there's a little drop-down you can choose from in the Configuration panel). 
  * When you specify these dependencies, Polynote will create a notebook-specific virtual environment and install those dependencies inside it.
  * The virtual environment is configured to delegate to the system python environment so packages that already exist won't be installed again. It's persisted as well so it won't be recreated every time you restart polynote. 
* Support for base `default.yml` to be provided in distributions - no more clobbering people's configs!
* Fix for broken VIM mode 
* Improvements to data display:
  * Add chrome-inspector-style display of structures and arrays
  * Add Schema tab to inspector UI for table data
  * Some refactoring/removal of duplicate stuff
  * Add encoding of array fields to spark table data
* Create notebooks directory if it doesn't exist

# 0.1.17 (July 16, 2019)

* Move cell controls to top of cell, horizontally
  * Each cell has lang selector
  * Buttons to show/hide code and output
* Add new Vega spec interpreter for generating plots
* Add new inspection UI
  * Inspection comes up in a modal
  * Remove value column from symbol table
* Upgraded plot editor
  * Can save plot to a Vega spec cell
  * Better UI, can edit size and titles, functioning scatter plot
* Editor size adjusts after code folding

# 0.1.16 (July 3, 2019)

* Remove annoying jep uninstall message [#328]
* Overhaul Scala compilation for better serializability and stability. [#330]
  * Lift user-defined classes to package namespace (no more inner classes!)

    than imports to avoid closing over the entire cell. 
* Fix regression causing wide output to stretch cell too far [#333]
* Improvements to completions [#335]
