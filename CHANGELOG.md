  * When you specify these dependencies, Polynote will create a notebook-specific virtual environment and install those dependencies inside it.
  * The virtual environment is configured to delegate to the system python environment so packages that already exist won't be installed again. It's persisted as well so it won't be recreated every time you restart polynote.

* Overhaul Scala compilation for better serializability and stability. [#330]
  * Lift user-defined classes to package namespace (no more inner classes!)

    than imports to avoid closing over the entire cell.
