# Getting Started

Welcome to Polynote! Polynote is a different kind of notebook. 

It supports mixing multiple languages in one notebook, and sharing data between them seamlessly. 
It encourages reproducible notebooks with its immutable data model.

Get started by [installing Polynote](installation.md), or by taking a [tour](tour.md) of the UI!

When you're ready, check out the [User Guide](basic-usage.md) for more information. Or if you need to customize your 
installation, head over to the [configuration](configuration.md) section.
